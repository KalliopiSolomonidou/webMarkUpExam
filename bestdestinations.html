                    <h2>
                        Santorini
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Santorini is a Greek island in the middle of the Aegean Sea. Back in 1450 BC, a massive volcanic
                    eruption caused the middle of the isle to collapse. It left a steep-edged crater known as a caldera
                    eeping above the waves, which today is a spectacular sight from the island’s clifftops. Greece’s hot
                    weather means a long summer season during which to enjoy the views, too – our Santorini package
                    holidays span May to October so you can enjoy also off season options!

                        Cyprus

                <p>
                    Thanks to its sandy stretches, ancient sights and up-tempo nightlife, Cyprus is a firm holiday
                    favorite, attracting everyone from families to clubbers. A mix of laidback and lively resorts fringe
                    the island, along with beautiful beaches – 64 are Blue Flag-certified. And if you go inland, you’ll
                    find sleepy villages, hidden hamlets, and the scenic Troodos Mountains. Larnaca, Paphos, Limassol
                    and of course Nicosia are the main cities and areas to visit. Food is also amazing!

                    Portugal’s capital city has a lot going for it. It’s got over 1,000 years of history under its belt,
                    which you can learn about at some of Lisbon’s biggest landmarks, like the Cathedral of Saint Mary
                    Major and the Jeronimos Monastery – the latter’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city boasts a
                    by-the-coast plot, too, so there’s an ample supply of waterfront restaurants for you to get your
                    hands on during a Lisbon city break. Head to the old town, meanwhile, and you can unwind with an
                    espresso in one of the cobbled plazas.

                    Barcelona city breaks take you to a place so diverse that most visitors barely scratch the surface
                    of
                    what it has to offer. Each neighbourhood, or ‘barrio’, brings something unique to the tourist map.
                    On
                    a whistle-stop tour of the city you could see the bustling streets off Las Ramblas make way for the
                    ancient sights of the Gothic quarter, and the graffitied walls in Poblenou lead down to the sands at
                    La Barceloneta.

                    Amsterdam’s storybook scenery is instantly recognisable. The city’s packed full of narrow streets
                    and
                    canals – it’s a great place to get lost in. Tall, thin houses line the streets – they’re pretty
                    uniform
                    at first glance, but if you look a bit closer, you'll see each one’s unique. Our selection of hotels
                    are sprinkled in and around the city's iconic lanes, either by a canal or close to one of the city's
                    key sights. Plus, you'll find plenty of metro stations nestled into the mix, making getting and
                    about
                    around the rest of Amsterdam a piece of cake.

                    Not many cities can rival Paris in the culture stakes. Its hundreds upon hundreds of museums,
                    monuments,
                    and gardens mean no two trips here are the same. Come face-to-face with that iconic Mona Lisa smile
                    at
                    the Louvre. Kick back in the Champ de Mars park after dark to watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle. Or,
                    dip
                    into bohemian Montmartre to shop for art, sip coffee at an outdoor café, and catch a cabaret show at
                    the Moulin Rouge.
