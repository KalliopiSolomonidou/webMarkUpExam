                    Santorini is a Greek island in the middle of the Aegean Sea. Back in 1450 BC, a massive volcanic
                    eruption caused the middle of the isle to collapse. It left a steep-edged crater known as a caldera
                    eeping above the waves, which today is a spectacular sight from the island’s clifftops. Greece’s hot
                    weather means a long summer season during which to enjoy the views, too – our Santorini package
                    holidays span May to October so you can enjoy also off season options!

                    Thanks to its sandy stretches, ancient sights and up-tempo nightlife, Cyprus is a firm holiday
                    favorite, attracting everyone from families to clubbers. A mix of laidback and lively resorts fringe
                    the island, along with beautiful beaches – 64 are Blue Flag-certified. And if you go inland, you’ll
                    find sleepy villages, hidden hamlets, and the scenic Troodos Mountains. Larnaca, Paphos, Limassol
                    and of course Nicosia are the main cities and areas to visit. Food is also amazing!

                    Portugal’s capital city has a lot going for it. It’s got over 1,000 years of history under its belt,
                    which you can learn about at some of Lisbon’s biggest landmarks, like the Cathedral of Saint Mary
                    Major and the Jeronimos Monastery – the latter’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city boasts a
                    by-the-coast plot, too, so there’s an ample supply of waterfront restaurants for you to get your
                    hands on during a Lisbon city break. Head to the old town, meanwhile, and you can unwind with an
                    espresso in one of the cobbled plazas.
